Write a command line program in your preferred language to process the log file and return the most active cookie for specified day. The example below shows how we'll execute your program.
Assumptions:
? If multiple cookies meet that criteria, please return all of them on separate lines. 
? Please only use additional libraries for testing, logging and cli-parsing. There are libraries for most languages which make this too easy (e.g pandas) and we’d like you to show off your coding skills. 
? You can assume -d parameter takes date in UTC time zone.
? You have enough memory to store the contents of the whole file. 
? Cookies in the log file are sorted by timestamp (most recent occurrence is the first line of the file).
Running Instructions:
* Make sure python 3 is installed in your system.
* Usage $ python mostVisitedCookie.py <filename> -d <query_date>
* For example: python mostVisitedCookie.py cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09 




Code Reference:
* mostVisitedCookie – This file is the entry point for this project. For the given query date all the cookie id in the csv file is processed.
* cookieStore -  Initially processed data will be written into cookie store. Then most visited cookies are retrieved for the given query date.
* testCookieSearch – contains all unit test cases 
* htmlcov - contains test coverage reports
* cookieSampleData- This contains the data that is to be processed.
